# Gondwana API Checker

A simple PHP + HTML app to test rates and availability from Gondwana's API.

## Features

- Dynamic form with date and age inputs
- Sends POST request to backend
- Calls Gondwana API using test Unit Type IDs
- Displays Unit Name, Date Range, rate, availability, and full JSON response which I've hidden from users.

## How to Run

1. Host on a PHP-enabled server (e.g. XAMPP)
2. Open `index.html` in the browser
3. Make sure `api.php` and `functions.php` are in the same folder
